# Financial Mathematics

Financial Mathematics is an interdisciplinary field that combines mathematical theory, statistics, economics, and finance to analyze and understand financial markets, products, and investments. The goal of Financial Mathematics is to develop models and methods that can be used to price financial instruments, manage risks, and make informed decisions about investments.

In this repository, I covered *MATLAB* implimentation of some calculators and functions that can be used for financial purposes.

**covered calculators and functions:**

* Accumulated value 
* Annuity payment 
* Bond duration 
* Cumulative distribution 
* D1 value 
* D2 value 
* DLTA for interest rate
* European call option
* Future value 
* Future value of a dollar 
* Future value of annuity
* Future value of cash flows
* Net interest rate equivalent 
* Percentage change 
* Present value 
* Present value of annuity
* Rate of return calculator
* The present value of cash flow

## Applications

Financial Mathematics has a wide range of applications in the financial industry, including:

- **Portfolio Management:** Financial Mathematics is used to develop investment strategies that optimize returns while minimizing risk.
- **Risk Management:** Financial Mathematics is used to develop models and methods for managing financial risk.
- **Asset Pricing:** Financial Mathematics is used to develop pricing models for financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, options, and derivatives.
- **Financial Engineering:** Financial Mathematics is used to develop new financial products and strategies.
- **Quantitative Trading:** Financial Mathematics is used to develop algorithms and models for quantitative trading.

## Conclusion

Overall, Financial Mathematics plays a critical role in the modern financial industry, providing the tools and methods needed to analyze and understand complex financial systems and make informed decisions about investments and risk management.

This repository is specifically focusing on the implementation of financial calculators and functions using **MATLAB**.
